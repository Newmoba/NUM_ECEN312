Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:1107 - Pack was unable to combine the symbols listed below into a
   single IOB component because the site type selected is not compatible. The
   component type is determined by the types of logic and the properties and
   configuration of the logic it contains. In this case an IO component of type
   IOB was chosen because the IO contains symbols and/or properties consistent
   with output or bi-directional usage and contains no other symbols or
   properties that require a more specific IO component type. Please double
   check that the types of logic elements and all of their relevant properties
   and configuration options are compatible with the physical site type of the
   constraint.

   Summary:
   Symbols involved:
   	BUF symbol "an_3_OBUF" (Output Signal = an<3>)
   	PAD symbol "an<3>" (Pad Signal = an<3>)
   Component type involved: IOB
   Site Location involved: E18
   Site Type involved: IBUF


Mapping completed.
